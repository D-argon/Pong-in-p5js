# Pong-in-p5js v0.33
First project using p5js.org (based on jvscript, html & css)

heyo

so the code is portuguese oriented bc I'm brazilian.
I'll prob add an english glossary for the var's,
it uses a 2d collision library ("collisionRectCircle" function)


u can use the link:

for a fullscreen playthrough

arrow UP or Down, for respective movement,
"r" for reset

:P


I recreated Pong by following an online class of programming logic,
added some personal characteristics (old green computer UI, original sounds n myself thinked codes)

To do list:

- fix square functionality (off collision);
- improve Robot wall """AI""";
- improve wall/ball superposition fix;
